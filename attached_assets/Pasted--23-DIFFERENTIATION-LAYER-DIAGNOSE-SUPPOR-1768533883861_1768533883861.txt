=====================================================
23) DIFFERENTIATION LAYER — “DIAGNOSE → SUPPORT → GROW”
=====================================================
EduBridge must not feel like a normal portal. It must feel like a caring learning system
that finds the real reason and gives maximum support.

Create 3 signature systems:
A) Student Support Engine (Diagnosis → Prescription)
B) Guided Care UX (Human support in interface)
C) Community Games + Points (Motivation loop)

-----------------------------------------------------
23.A) STUDENT SUPPORT ENGINE (DIAGNOSIS → PRESCRIPTION)
-----------------------------------------------------
Add a dedicated “Support Center” in each portal that translates the student’s difficulty
into an actionable plan. It must be visible and feel premium.

Add data:
support_plan: {
  id, studentId, track, blockers[], rootCauses[], prioritySubjects[],
  weeklyPlan:{sessionsPerWeek, sprintPerDayMin, homeworkRules[]},
  accommodations:{...},
  createdAt, updatedAt
}

1) Root Cause Clarity (Admin + Tutor view)
- Show “Root Cause Summary” box (1–2 lines)
- Show “Evidence” bullets (based on questionnaire + tutor notes + sprint outcomes)
- Show “Prescription” (teaching method + rules)

2) Student View (child-friendly but formal)
Add “My Support Plan” drawer:
- “What I’m great at”
- “What is blocking me”
- “How we fix it this week” (2 actions only)
- “Today’s rule” (one rule: micro steps / visuals / safe space / backfill)

3) Automatic Support Actions
After each session note or sprint:
- Update support_plan insights
- If a pattern repeats (e.g. memory leak), auto-suggest:
  - shorter tasks
  - extra recap
  - new foundation backfill
- Notify admin if student is not improving.

-----------------------------------------------------
23.B) GUIDED CARE UX (INTERFACE THAT FEELS LIKE SUPPORT)
-----------------------------------------------------
Add “Care moments” inside UI, not only chat.

1) “You’re not alone” micro-cues:
- If student fails: show calm supportive hint + one retry option
- If student misses session: show “Let’s reschedule” + notify parent/admin
- If student does well: show praise (formal) + unlock points

2) Tutor “Care workflow” (fast)
- After each session note, show:
  “Write 1 encouragement line (optional)”
- This becomes the student’s recap message and drives motivation.

3) Parent “Care prompts”
- Parent portal shows:
  - “How to help this week” (2 steps)
  - “What not to do” (gentle guidance)
  - “When to worry” (only if necessary)

-----------------------------------------------------
23.C) COMMUNITY GAMES + POINTS (PORTAL-ONLY, SAFE)
-----------------------------------------------------
Add a “Games & League” system that drives engagement but stays educational.
NO public chat. NO contact exchange. Everything stays inside platform.

DATA:
points_ledger: { id, userId, studentId?, type, points, reason, createdAt }
badges: { id, code, title, criteria, icon }
leaderboards: { id, scope, period, entries[] }
game_sessions: { id, gameId, studentId, score, accuracy, duration, createdAt }

POINTS (simple, meaningful):
- Sprint completed: +10
- Homework submitted: +15
- Session attended: +20
- Streak day: +5
- Helping behavior (tutor award): +5
- Policy violation attempts: -30 (admin configurable)

BADGES:
- “Consistency Star” (7-day streak)
- “Comeback Kid” (improvement after low scores)
- “Focus Master” (3 sprints without drop)
- “Math Climber” / “Reading Builder”

GAMES (mini, educational, 2–5 minutes):
1) Speed Match (Math facts / vocabulary)
2) Memory Ladder (sequence recall, working memory training)
3) Word Builder (spelling/phonics)
4) Logic Paths (pattern recognition)

Each game:
- grade-adjusted difficulty
- no free typing (mostly tap/select)
- ends with:
  score, accuracy, 1 improvement tip
- contributes to signals lightly (optional) and to points strongly.

LEAGUE SYSTEM (safe community competition):
- Weekly leaderboard per grade bracket:
  Grade 1–3, 4–6, 7–10
- Display only:
  first name + masked ID (no last name, no contact)
- Allow opt-out (parent setting).

HOME SCREEN DISC (signature UI element):
Add on Student dashboard:
- a clean “Community Disc” widget:
  - Current points
  - Current league rank
  - “Play 3-min game” CTA
  - “Weekly challenge” CTA

Tutor portal:
- “Award points” button (limited) per student for good behavior/effort
- “Challenge suggestions” based on blocker (memory game for memory blocker)

Admin portal:
- Full control:
  - point rules editor
  - badges editor
  - weekly challenges content
  - moderation
- Admin can disable games per student or per grade.

Parent portal:
- Shows points + badge progress
- Allows:
  opt-out of leaderboard
  playtime limits (e.g. max 10 min/day)

SAFETY FOR COMMUNITY:
- No free chat in games.
- No usernames beyond first name + masked ID.
- No sharing text fields.
- All actions logged.

-----------------------------------------------------
23.D) WHAT MAKES IT “NOT A NORMAL PORTAL” (MUST BE OBVIOUS)
-----------------------------------------------------
On every dashboard add a premium “Support + Growth” section:

Student:
- “My Support Plan” + “Play 3-min skill game”
Tutor:
- “Where we stopped” + “Support prescription”
Admin:
- “Improvement & Red Flags” + “Incidents & policy”
Parent:
- “Weekly care steps” + “Progress & motivation”

This makes EduBridge feel like a real supportive system, not a school portal.

-----------------------------------------------------
23.E) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (DIFFERENTIATION)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Students can play a mini-game from dashboard; points update instantly.
- Weekly leaderboard shows rank and masked names.
- Tutor can award points; admin can change rules.
- Support plan exists per student and updates after sessions/sprints.
- Parent can set play limits and opt-out of leaderboard.
- No contact sharing possible in any community feature.
