PASTE THIS AS THE FINAL “CAREERS + TUTOR HIRING” CONFIGURATION/WIRING BLOCK
(Keep the rest of the EduBridge portal prompt as-is. This is the complete, pro-grade Careers button + hiring system.)

=====================================================
24) HOMEPAGE CAREERS BUTTON + TUTOR RECRUITMENT (FULL WIRING)
=====================================================

24.1) HOMEPAGE HEADER (PUBLIC)
- Add a top navigation link: “Careers” → /careers
- Add a header CTA button (secondary style): “Become a Tutor” → /careers/tutors
- Keep the existing header layout, colors, and typography.
- On mobile: place “Careers” inside the hamburger menu; keep “Become a Tutor” as a prominent button below menu items.

24.2) PUBLIC ROUTES (NEW)
- /careers            (Careers Hub)
- /careers/tutors     (Tutor Recruitment Landing)
- /careers/tutors/apply   (Tutor Apply Wizard)
- /careers/tutors/status  (Tutor Applicant Status Tracker)
- /careers/team       (Simple form page only)

24.3) CAREERS HUB PAGE (/careers)
UI: premium, minimal, 2 primary cards only
Card A: “Become a Tutor” → /careers/tutors
Card B: “Join EduBridge Team” → /careers/team
- Keep it lightweight and fast; no heavy animations; use spacing/whitespace.

24.4) TUTOR RECRUITMENT LANDING (/careers/tutors)
Conversion layout:
1) Hero: headline + 1-liner + “Apply Now” primary button → /careers/tutors/apply
2) 4-step process (visual stepper):
   Apply → Skill Check → Verification → Start Teaching
3) “Tutor Standards” chips:
   Clarity • Patience • Reliability • Policy Compliance
4) FAQ accordion (short)
5) Sticky “Apply Now” CTA on mobile
Performance:
- Lazy-load non-critical images
- Use compressed images and consistent card spacing.

=====================================================
25) TUTOR APPLICATION FLOW (ADVANCED + ULTRA SIMPLE)
=====================================================

25.1) ROLES + ACCESS
- If user is not logged in, force login/signup before apply
- Signup creates role = tutor_applicant
- Admin approval upgrades role = tutor
- Only role tutor_applicant can access:
/careers/tutors/status and edit their draft

25.2) DATA MODELS (LOCALSTORAGE DB)
Add/ensure these entities exist:

tutor_applications: {
  id,
  userId,
  status: draft|submitted|held_by_ai|screening|approved|rejected|needs_changes,
  qualityScore: number,            // 0–100 (AI Analyzer output)
  dimensionScores: { clarity, structure, empathy, subjectFit, communication, reliability, policyCompliance, availability },
  riskFlags: string[],             // e.g. ["low_availability","weak_demo","policy_risk"]
  improvementChecklist: string[],  // max 5 items
  autoSummary: string,             // 1–2 lines
  profile: {
    firstName, email, country, timezone,
    languages[],
    subjects[],
    gradesSupported[],
    experienceLevel, educationLevel,
    teachingStyleTags[],
    availability: { days[], slots[] }, // slots: "4-6pm" etc
    shortBio,
    introVideoUrl?
  },
  skillCheck: {
    microTeachingAnswers: { q1, q2, q3 }
  },
  verification: {
    idVerificationStatus: off|pending|passed|failed,
    backgroundCheckStatus: off|pending|passed|failed
  },
  createdAt, updatedAt
}

Also add admin notifications:
notifications: { id, forRole:"admin", type:"tutor_application_new", payload, createdAt, read }

25.3) APPLY WIZARD (/careers/tutors/apply) — 2–4 MIN, AUTO-SAVE

- Progress indicator: 1/4, 2/4...
- Auto-save draft after each field change to:
  tutor_application_draft_v1_{userId}

=====================================================
26) AI PRE-SCREENING GATE (MIN 70% BEFORE ADMIN SEES IT)
=====================================================

26.1) SETTINGS (ADMIN CONFIG)
Add /admin/settings tab: “Hiring”
- defaultMinTutorScore = 70 (editable)
- autoHoldBelowThreshold = ON (default)
- strictModePolicyRiskHold = ON (recommended)
- allowAdminOverride = ON (default)

26.2) AI ANALYZER PIPELINE (MUST WORK WITHOUT EXTERNAL API)
Implement AIAnalyzer.evaluateTutorApplication(application):
Outputs:
- qualityScore (0–100)
- dimensionScores:
  clarity, structure, empathy, subjectFit, communication, reliability, policyCompliance, availability
- riskFlags
- improvementChecklist (max 5)
- autoSummary (1–2 lines)

MVP Scoring (deterministic heuristics; no API required):
- Completeness: 0–20
- Availability breadth: 0–15
- Subject/grade fit: 0–10
- Micro teaching quality: 0–35
  - has steps (1) / (2) or “First/Then”
  - student-focused wording
  - concrete actions
  - respectful tone
- Policy compliance: 0–10
  - no contact/off-platform hints (use PolicyEngine)
- Communication clarity: 0–10
  - short, readable, structured

Risk flags:
- low_availability (availability score low)
- weak_demo (micro teaching score low)
- missing_profile_fields
- policy_risk (PolicyEngine match)

26.3) THRESHOLD BEHAVIOR (HARD GATE)
On submit:
IF qualityScore >= defaultMinTutorScore AND (strictModePolicyRiskHold OFF OR no policy_risk):
- status = submitted
- create admin notification: tutor_application_new
- show in admin queue

ELSE:
- status = held_by_ai (or needs_changes)
- DO NOT notify admin
- applicant sees:
  - score + target score
  - checklist (max 5)
  - “Fix & Resubmit” (only edits micro answers + availability + bio)

Admin override:
- Admin can view “Held by AI” tab and manually pull into review.

Optional upgrade:
- If AI_API_KEY exists, plug a real LLM provider behind the same AIAnalyzer interface.
- Still run PolicyEngine before and after AI output.
- Must not break MVP if key missing.

=====================================================
27) ADMIN HIRING CENTER (FULL CONTROL)
=====================================================

27.1) ADMIN ROUTES (NEW)
- /admin/tutor-applications
Add widget on /admin command center:
- “Tutor Applications” (New / Held / Needs Changes)

27.2) ADMIN LIST (HIGH SIGNAL, LOW EFFORT)
Table columns:
- Name
- Subjects
- Languages
- Availability
- Score badge:
  90–100 Elite / 80–89 Strong / 70–79 Pass / <70 Held
- Flags chips (max 2)
Actions:

27.3) DRAWER VIEW + ACTIONS

- Micro teaching answers
- Availability preview
- Risk flags + checklist
Buttons:
- Request Changes (status=needs_changes + in-app message checklist)
- Approve

- Set tutor isActive=true
- Send in-app message: “Approved — complete onboarding”
- Tutor becomes visible in matching engine immediately

Reject must:
- status=rejected
- Optional message template to applicant

Request changes must:
- status=needs_changes
- Provide exact items checklist

=====================================================
28) TUTOR POST-APPROVAL ONBOARDING (QUALITY + COMPLIANCE)
=====================================================
On first login to /tutor:
1) Tutor Contract Modal (must accept):
   - No sharing contact details
   - No off-platform tutoring
   - All sessions must be on EduBridge
   - Violations logged and may cause suspension
   If declined: tutor remains inactive

2) Setup Checklist page (60 sec):
   - confirm subjects/grades/languages
   - confirm availability
   - confirm teaching style tags
   - done → tutor active + eligible for assignment

=====================================================
29) POLICY ENGINE INTEGRATION (MUST APPLY TO CAREERS TOO)
=====================================================
Apply PolicyEngine to:
- applicant messaging
- AI chat
- tutor portal messaging
- any free text fields in application (bio, micro answers)

If blocked:
- prevent submission if policy_risk is severe OR mark held_by_ai in strict mode
- log incident + admin notification (if user already in system)

=====================================================
30) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (CAREERS BUTTON + FULL WIRING)
=====================================================
- “Careers” appears on homepage header and routes to /careers
- “Become a Tutor” CTA routes to /careers/tutors
- Apply wizard auto-saves drafts, restores on refresh
- Submit triggers AIAnalyzer score and flags
- Only score >= 70 appears in admin “New Tutor Applications”
- Score < 70 goes to held_by_ai with improvement checklist + resubmit loop
- Admin approves → user role becomes tutor → access /tutor works immediately
- Approved tutor appears in /admin/matching and can be assigned to students
- PolicyEngine blocks contact-sharing anywhere in this flow
